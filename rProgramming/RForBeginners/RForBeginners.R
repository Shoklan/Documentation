# What does rnorm do?
# Density, distribution function, quantile function
# and random generation for the normal distribution 
# with mean equal to mean and standard deviation equal to sd.
?rnorm
n <- rnorm(1)

# ls can filter items
ls(pat="n")

# ls.str() will list extra data
ls.str()

# Confirmed: "A vector is a variable in the commonly admitted meaning" p.11

# I want numbers from 1-200, with a 2# step.

# Factors

# Factors tell you what is in a vector as well as the unique value.

# Matrices
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = NULL)
# Always remember that R uses rows then columns for everything.
# Let's mess around with matrices
m <- matrix(1:20, 5, 4)


# What is ts() for?

# Expressions are awesome!
quadraticExpP <- expression(-b + (sqrt(b*b -4*a*c)/2))
quadraticExpM <- expression(-b - (sqrt(b*b -4*a*c)/2))

# Remember that b,a,c needs to be defined!
b <- 10; a <- 5; c <- 2;

# eval will then use the expression!
eval(quadraticExpP)
eval(quadraticExpM)

# let's put them in a function so it returns them both when you put them in.
quadratic <- function(a,b,c){
  c(eval(quadraticExpP), eval(quadraticExpM))
}

# It works, but doesn't include a case for negative numbers. But, oh well.

# Changing object Types:
##### Numeric:   as.numeric()
#        FALSE - 0
#         TRUE - 1
#          "7" - 7
#          "a" - NA
##### Logical:   as.logical()
#            0 - FALSE
#     #'s != 0 - TRUE
#      "FALSE" - FALSE
#       "TRUE" - TRUE
#      "CHARS" - NA
##### Character  as.character()
#          1,2 - "1", "2"
#        FALSE - "TRUE"
#         TRUE - "TRUE"

# Boolean comparison's are applied against all items in a vector.

# ACCESSING DATA! FINALLY!
# Indexing with vectors is easy.
# A matrix data can be acessed using m[i,j], where i=row;j=col.
#    Make sure to include the comma at all time.

# Negative indexes can be used to suppress rows/columns.

# NOTE: You can use Boolean expressions to select against index values!
#
#  MATRIX
#    col names: 
#                 name1    name 2
#    row names: 
#       name 3      a       y
#
#       name 4      x       b
#
#   To get b, call MATRIX["name 4", "name 2"]

# Whoa, there is a GUI data edit prog?
# data.entry(x) ?
data.entry(m)

# That's pretty cool!
