- Most type checking functions are available in guards
- You can define a function contingent on a guard.
- Ex: `def credit( balance, amt) where amt > 0` works in a defmodule.
- The pipeline operator `|>`.
- ` [list_of_values] |> Enum.map(fn i -> i * 2 end)` is a valuable pattern.
- You can convert a lson to a list using `parse_json_to_message_list()`.
- `.exs` stands for *elixer script*.
- The runs instead of compiles to byte code.
- `c()` is a function that pulls modules into iex and compiles them.
- A single quote means *string of characters* instead of double quotes.
- Erlang has poor string support.
- `!` in Elixir means *I throw an error on bad input*.
- Elixir has emoji support XD.
- `defp` means a private function.
- `\\` means *default argument* in a function declaration.
- You can re-alias names using `alias :math, as: Math:`.
- This will map Erlang's math module to an Elixir friendly name.
- You can also import all modules from a module, or selectively.
- The format is `import Math, :only [pi: 0]`; where 0 is the arity of the module.
- Macros are code that write code.
- You can see the **Abstract Syntax Tree** by calling `quote()`.
- You can get a last result using `v(-<n>)`.
- Process Ids are at the heart of concurrency in Elixir.
- Processes are the result of spawning a defined function.
- When you've done that, you will get a process id number.
- You can test if a process is alive using `Process.alive? <pid>`.
- `spawn_link` will do something similar but will link you to the process spawned.
- `after <n>` will crash your program is nothing happens for the specified <n> time; in milliseconds.
- A **Mesh** is when you connect multiple Erlang Nodes together across multiple computers.
- **OTP** stands for Open Telecom Platform.
- You can install all updates using `mix deps.get` in a package.
- A **Module Accessor** is like a constant and is defined with `@varname = [:hue, :turtle]`.
