This directory is for my own experimentation with Python.
The exercises are taken from the book "ThinkPython" by Allen B. Downey.
If you're looking to follow suit, the book is available online at http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ .
As I progress, I will probably list interesting points in this document.

Python was giving me a lot of trouble with it's Order of Operations. It seems like, unlike Java, that logical operators have a higher precedence? Took me too long ot figure out that Python REALLY wanted those parenthesis around the logical statements. [is_triangle.py]
